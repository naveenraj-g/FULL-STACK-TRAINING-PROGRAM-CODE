Coding Challenge #3

There are two basketball teams, Eagles and Sharks. They play against each other 3 times. The team with the highest average score wins the championship trophy!

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below.

2. Compare the team’s average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console. Remember that there can also be a draw if both averages are the same.

3. BONUS 1: Add a requirement for a minimum score of 80 points. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team and at the same time achieves at least 80 points on average.

4. BONUS 2: The minimum score also applies to a draw! So, a draw only happens when both teams have the same average score and both have at least 80 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

TEST DATA: Eagles score 75, 89, and 95. Sharks score 92, 81, and 78.
TEST DATA BONUS 1: Eagles score 85, 92, and 88. Sharks score 79, 90, and 82.
TEST DATA BONUS 2: Eagles score 88, 90, and 82. Sharks score 84, 91, and 85.

Coding Challenge #4

Sophie wants to create a simple delivery fee calculator for an online shopping app. In her city, the delivery fee is 10% of the order value if it’s between 100 and 500. If the value is outside this range, the delivery fee is 15%.

1. Your task is to calculate the delivery fee based on the order value. Create a variable called deliveryFee for this. You’re not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅 (You can start with an if/else if you like, and then try converting it into a ternary operator!)

2. Print a string to the console containing the order value, the delivery fee, and the final amount (order + deliveryFee).
Example: “The order was 450, the delivery fee was 45, and the total amount 495”

TEST DATA: Try with order values 450, 80, and 600.

HINTS:
- To calculate 15% of a value, multiply it by 0.15.
- Value X is between 100 and 500 if X >= 100 && X <= 500.
